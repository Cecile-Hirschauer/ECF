# EcoGreenFund

## Backend: EcoGreenFund & LeafToken Smart Contracts

### Overview
`EcoGreenFund` is a blockchain-based crowdfunding platform dedicated to supporting environmental projects. Leveraging the Ethereum network, it facilitates the creation, funding, and management of campaigns aimed at sustainability efforts. Contributors are rewarded with `LeafToken`, an ERC20 token, acknowledging their support towards these causes.

`LeafToken` serves as the platform's reward mechanism, incentivizing contributions with a digital asset that represents a stake in the environmental ventures supported through `EcoGreenFund`.

### Features
- **Campaign Management**: Users can launch and oversee crowdfunding campaigns for environmental initiatives.
- **Ether Contributions**: Support campaigns using Ether and receive `LeafToken` rewards.
- **Funds Withdrawal**: Campaign owners can withdraw accumulated funds post-campaign, contingent on reaching the funding target.
- **Refunds**: Contributors can claim refunds for campaigns that fall short of their financial goals.
- **Reward System**: Contributions are rewarded with `LeafToken`, promoting a cycle of support and recognition.
